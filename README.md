## 🧠 Development Process & Key Learnings

Hello World was built as a **collaborative team project**, simulating a real-world development workflow.

**Process highlights:**

1. **Ideation & planning**

   - Team brainstorming sessions
   - Feature prioritization
   - User stories definition

2. **Design**

   - Whiteboard wireframes
   - Full UI flow designed in Figma
   - Visual consistency & UX refinement

3. **Architecture**

   - Data schema & API route design
   - Backend built first to unblock frontend
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Implementation**
   - Backend completed first to allow parallel frontend work
   - Frontend development followed with iterative refinement

## 🧩 Technical Highlights & Challenges

| Area                   | Approach / Lessons Learned                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication**     | Implemented JWT-based auth with protected routes.                                        |
| **Image uploads**      | Handled multipart uploads with Multer; required careful frontend/backend coordination.   |
| **State management**   | Complex UI interactions exposed timing and async state challenges in React.              |
| **MUI learning curve** | Pre-built components sped up development but required deep customization understanding.  |
| **CORS & uploads**     | Learned correct multipart handling and CORS configuration through debugging real issues. |

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned

- Full-stack apps require **tight frontend/backend alignment**
- Image uploads are deceptively complex and benefit from ownership clarity
- React state can behave unexpectedly without careful planning
- Over-scoping increases risk in short timelines
- Team communication and early planning save massive refactor time later

---

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- 💬 Real-time messaging or notifications
- 🔔 Activity feeds for followed users/projects
- 🏷️ Advanced filters and search
- 👥 Team roles & permissions
- 📊 Project progress tracking
- 🔒 Reinforced validation & error handling
